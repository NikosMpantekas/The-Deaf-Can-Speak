# The-Deaf-Language

<b>Prologue</b>

If you are older than 20 years old and a bit social you have been in a situation that you had to talk, or better, communicate, with a deaf person and you were unable to do that. I have been in that situation many times in my life, so I had an idea to help these people to communicate easy with others. 

<b>The idea</b>


The idea is to make a glove, and in the future an implant, in where the deaf person puts in his hand or hands and the motion translates to words in a screen or into voice the assistance of google translate, Bixby or Siri

<b>The main Question</b>


Why a deaf person buys this prototype, instead using google translate to write the phrase and just click the ‘voice’ button to give voice to himself? 
I am glad you asked that!
This prototype has been developed as a glove that the deaf man wears in his hand. I have already started developing an implant, that in goes down of the upper skin of the fingers, just like a tattoo, but it will be invisible. There is a small problem with the power supply and how this will be completely under the skin and haw energy to work, but we have other problems to solve first, like the economical part.

<b>Economics </b>

This project, when it’s done in papers and schematics, it would cost around 2,000 dollars to make, and all of that without the effort of the people that will participate to it.

<b>How will it look like?</b>
  
  
Like a single glove. It is very complicated the method that we are making it because it has to be waterproof, dustproof, and most important, lightweight. The implant will be made out of titanium parts, 3d printer of course, to make it as lightweight as possible.
