# The-Deaf-Can-Speak

<b>Prologue</b>

If you are older than 20 years old and a bit social you have been in a situation that you had to talk, or better, communicate, with a deaf person and you were unable to do that. I have been in that situation many times in my life, so I had an idea to help these people to communicate easy with others. 

* <b>The idea</b>


The idea is to make a glove, and in the future an implant, in where the deaf person puts in his hand or hands and the motion translates to words in a screen or into voice the assistance of google translate, Bixby or Siri

* <b>The main Question</b>


Why a deaf person buys this prototype, instead using google translate to write the phrase and just click the ‘voice’ button to give voice to himself? 
I am glad you asked that!
This prototype has been developed as a glove that the deaf man wears in his hand. I have already started developing an implant, that in goes down of the upper skin of the fingers, just like a tattoo, but it will be invisible. There is a small problem with the power supply and how this will be completely under the skin and haw energy to work, but we have other problems to solve first, like the economical part.

* <b>Economics </b>

This project, when it’s done in papers and schematics, it would cost around 2,000 dollars to make, and all of that without the effort of the people that will participate to it.

* <b>How will it look like?</b>
  
  
Like a single glove. It is very complicated the method that we are making it because it has to be waterproof, dustproof, and most important, lightweight. The implant will be made out of titanium parts, 3d printer of course, to make it as lightweight as possible. 



* <b>The prototype idea</b>


The prototype requires first of all a human hand, no robots can join….
The glove has to be made out of material that doesn’t get wet and it should be durable enough to take over the everyday works. Every finder will have its own ‘flex sensor’, which will give information about how much each finger is bended. With that information, the main chip, which I prefer to be the atmega 328p, reads the combination of all the finder bend and translates it to words, in a lcd screen, or even sending the info to a phone and it translates them to voice. 



* <b>Problems we have to solve</b>


First of all is the economical part. In maze production the cost will be really small, close to 400 dollars or less*. In case of the implant, we don’t really know how much the cost will be, because we don’t know how much the surgery itself will cost. The second problem has to do with the implant. We can’t find a way yet to make the implant both 100% under skin and at the same time giving it power. We have a theory that we can harvest energy from the blood’s movement in the veins, but this is a next level of anthropology that we can’t reach it, yet of course.

<b>* Postscript</b>: The final product will contain 2 gloves, because we all know deaf people use their both hands to talk, right?
